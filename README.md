# Unsupervised-Image-Compression-via-Cycle-Consistency
Proposed a direct deep learning based image compression method via cycle consistency, where the neural network consists of an encoder and a symmetrical decoder. Both reconstruction loss and sparsity loss objectives are combined as the loss for the training process. Achieved a PSNR of 21 on validation set, and compression ratio of 5.33. The fully trained model is capable of compressing images for moderate quality with a very short runtime.
